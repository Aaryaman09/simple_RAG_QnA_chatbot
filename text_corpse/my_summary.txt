Professional Journey
Aaryaman is a skilled data scientist with 3+ years of experience. He works in the manufacturing domain, with in-depth exposure to MLOps, cloud services, data pipelines, and machine learning model deployment. His work involves supervised machine learning tasks, including those related to Promise Date Service Line (PDSL). He is committed to upskilling and expanding his competencies in:

Cloud Platforms: AWS (EC2, ECS, EKS, SageMaker), Azure, Google Cloud

MLOps: Model packaging, CI/CD using CodeBuild, CodePipeline, ECR

Tools & Frameworks: boto3, awswrangler, Evidently AI (for drift detection), Spark (including Spark AutoML), Docker, Kubernetes

DevOps Practices: Containerization with Docker, using ScriptProcessor and ProcessingStep in SageMaker pipelines, integrating model monitoring scripts, and automating email reports via SMTP

He works with both onshore and offshore teams, managing model development, evaluation, and production deployments. His recent tasks involved understanding and reproducing a complex AWS-based modeling pipeline that uses a custom Python package (modeling) and Docker containers built from wheels stored in ECR.

Aaryaman has trained juniors like Danyln, mentoring them in computer vision, OCR, and improved coding standards.

Technical Projects
SageMaker Pipelines: Built pipelines with multiple steps (e.g., model scoring followed by data drift monitoring using Evidently AI). Handled issues with Python packages not found in base Docker images by dynamically installing them in scripts.

Spark Integration: Handled large-scale transformations (e.g., on 1GB CSVs in S3) using AWS Glue and passed results into SageMaker workflows.

Email Notifications: Automated result-sharing via SMTP within SageMaker environments, overcoming connectivity issues (e.g., “Errno -2: Name or source not known”).

Monitoring and Drift Detection: Integrated Evidently AI in SageMaker workflows, generating data_drift.html reports and saving them to S3.

Offline Package Installations: Debugged import issues by embedding dependency installs in Python scripts running within containers.

Custom Tools: Recently built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application using Ollama, demonstrating interest in GenAI and applied LLMs.

Communication & Workplace Interaction
Aaryaman is articulate and professional in his workplace communications. He's written formal emails to HR and IT for access restoration, leave requests, and F&F settlement clarifications.
